      <h1><span class="highlight">ABOUT</span> ME</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Jamyr A. Patawaran and a student of Pampanga State Agricultural University. I always prefer simpliccity in my works. It takes time for myself and I always find lack of motivation doing something, that's why im working it to be better. </p>
      <p>I'm not an expert to one skill or something, I don't realy master one thing but just be good enough at that. That's why I can't say that I have a unique skill, tho I have a lot of Interest. </p>
	  <p>My primary interest is living, that's mainly the purpose I saw for myself. Taking Information Technology as a college course was a forced decision. I dont know if I would truly love this course but I will try to do my best!</p>
